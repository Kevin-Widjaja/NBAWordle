This is an NBA version of Wordle. 

It pulls all the names of active NBA players from basketball.realgm.com/nba/players as possible solutions. 

The goal of this game is to guess the NBA player's last name within 5 guesses, and after each guess, 
you are given hints. 

Your hints will either be an 'X', '0' or '1'. 
'1' means the letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
'0' means the letter is in the word but in the incorrect spot.
'X' means that the letter is not in the word in any spot.

For example, say the solution is Stephen "Curry" and your guess is Birch, your hint would look as follows:

Solution: curry
Guess:    birch
Hint:     XX10X

Use the hints to guess the NBA player to win the game.
